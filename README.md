# Muhammad Abbas | Front-End Developer

## 👋 About Me
I am a front-end developer focused on building **clean, responsive, and API-driven web applications**.

I work primarily with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and TypeScript**, turning real-world problems into practical user interfaces. My projects emphasize **API integration, loading/error handling, and maintainable component architecture**.

Previously, I worked as an **IT Support Intern at ICCI**, gaining hands-on experience with **Active Directory, Windows Server, system troubleshooting, and real-world IT operations**. This experience helps me build **secure, reliable front-end solutions**.

I am actively seeking **front-end internship or junior developer opportunities**.
